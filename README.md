- **Responsive Design:** The landing page is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good experience across different devices.
- **Informative Content:** The page provides information about the barbershop, highlighting the quality of services and the experience of the team.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS Modules:** For modular and scalable styling of the page.
- **React Icons:** For icons used in the interface.
